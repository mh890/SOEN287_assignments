CLIENT SERVER ARCHITECTURE
    -computing model in which the server hosts, delivers and manages most of the resources to be consumed by the client.
    -has one or more client computers connected to a central server over a network or internet connection
    -flow of data unidreictional and forms a cycle
    -initiated by client requesting some kind of data and server processes the request to send back some data
    -architecture necessary:
        - allows for distributed processing, enabling the system to handle large numbers of clients and data requests
        - seperation of front end and back end, making code maintenance and updates manageable
        - security
        - load balancing is responsible for distributing incoming network traffic across a group of backend servers to optimize resource usage
        - connectivity
